'''Greedy coverage solvers over precomputed path sets with known utility.

All solvers share the same sequential greedy assignment loop
(`greedy_assign_paths`); they differ in planning horizon and in how the
agent ordering is chosen:

- `full_horizon_greedy_solve`: plan full-length paths in one pass.
- `rolling_horizon_greedy_solve`: plan in chunks, carrying coverage state
  between rounds.
- `best_order_full_horizon_greedy_solve`: exhaustively try every agent
  ordering and keep the best (expensive baseline).
